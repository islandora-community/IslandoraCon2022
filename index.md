## IslandoraCon2022

As Covid-related restrictions begin to ease, UPEI has generously renewed their offer to host a hybrid [Islandora](https://www.islandora.ca/) conference, based in Charlottetown, PEI. 

The event is tentatively scheduled for **August 2 - 5th, 2022**, and we are currently hoping for **both online and in-person** workshops/presentations, with flexible options for registration.

**Are you interested in joining the conference program planning committee?** The upcoming meeting dates and registration for Zoom details can be accessed [using this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZElfu2hqTorGNYDda4sqCQyeSPLUbsCd-E9).

You can also visit the [Community page of the newly-launched Islandora website](https://www.islandora.ca/community) to see the most up-to-date listing of events on the Islandora Community Calendar.
