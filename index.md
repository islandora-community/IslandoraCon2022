## IslandoraCon2022

As Covid-related restrictions begin to ease, UPEI has generously renewed their offer to host a hybrid Islandora conference, based in Charlottetown, PEI. 

The event is tentatively scheduled for August 2 - 5th, 2022, and we are currently hoping for both online and in-person workshops/presentations, with flexible options for registration.

If you are interested in joining the conference program planning committee, the first meeting will be on March 22 at 2:00 pm Eastern. Register for a meeting invite and zoom details [using this link](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZArdu6uqjgjGN0Qs61Q1QgBzMFg-CbvgERd). 

If you would like to join the program committee, but can’t make this time, please write to Donald Moses at dmoses@upei.ca. If you have other feedback (perhaps you’ve been to an event that was hybrid that you thought went really well, or there is something you’d definitely like to see) please feel free to send it to Donald, or to community@islandora.ca. In the meantime, keep an eye out for additional information (including a call for proposals) as our plans evolve.
