I have done a longer version of this at a Open Meeting earlier this year. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tz5gZVDFnzA9TUYfozTyRBzOQu7DvZ3_khE8-Wl0EPY/edit#slide=id.p) is a copy of that version for reference.

#### Microservices and content processing 

1:00 - 2:30

Speakers: Alan Stanley, Kyle Hyunh 

Description: At Digital Scholarship Unit of UTSC, we developed an approach to run microservices jobs inside Drupal (with PHP) instead of Java applications (Apache Karaf). [Advanced Queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/advancedqueue) provides a user interface for jobs can be queued, managed (start, stop, delete) and monitored (error message) within a Drupal site. To improve our workflow with Advanced Queue, the [Advanced Queue Runner module](https://www.drupal.org/project/advancedqueue_runner) is developed to “daemonize” the Advanced Queue, so it can be run automatically in the background instead of triggering it manually by Cron or Drush command. We have currently implemented Triplestore indexing and Fits by using this approach.

#### Annual General Meeting

3:00 - 5:00

Register for a Zoom and calendar invite [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEsdO-qrj8iGtw5vYfB8mFXLNWXxmMr7VlO)!

This presentation will be of interest to anyone who is interested in cleaning their metadata. 

#### Integrating machine learning-based image entity extraction into Islandora

10:30 - 11:00

Speakers: Alexander O’Neill

Description: In 2020, the Library of Congress announced the Newspaper Navigator project, the work of their Innovator in Residence, Ben Lee. It employs machine learning to extract entities like maps, cartoons, headlines and ads from newspaper archives. In 2021, we worked with a team of 4th year computer science students at UPEI to adapt this technique to work with our large Islandora-hosted newspaper archive, Island Newspapers. The team was able to use the existing training data on our content, but built a whole new image processing pipeline, and an Islandora 7 solution pack to automatically extract entities from new and existing page images.
