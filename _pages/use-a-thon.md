# Use-A-Thon at IslandoraCon 2022

## What is a Use-a-Thon?

The Islandora Use-a-Thon is an opportunity to work with conference participants, learn new things, and configure Islandora to do something new! 

## How does it work? 

The latest version of Islandora is tightly integrated with Drupal, and very flexible, so many use cases can be solved with a combination of configuration and [Drupal contributed modules](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules). 

## Steps

### 1: Propose your idea! 

Is there something you want to learn how to do? Something you’ve been eager to understand how to do? [Propose your idea for the Use-a-thon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sw0CiOF_yavYgAs2XysK25D9_Ccc5798QskM_figf6o/edit?usp=sharing) or sign up for an existing idea!
